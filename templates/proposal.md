Abstract
========


Insert the abstract here. The abstract should summarize your research in
clear and concise language. You should write your abstract with the idea
that it may be the only section that will actually be read and the sole
representation of your research.

Some primary factors that you should consider for the abstract:

- Motivation: Why do we care?

- Problem statement: What are you trying to address?

- Approach: How will you address the problem?

- Results: What is the answer or expected answer?

- Conclusions: What are the implications?

# Introduction

Introduction to the research including background, current research in
the area, etc.

# Purpose or Hypothesis

The purpose or hypothesis of the research. This is a more general
overview of your research.

# Research Question(s)

Insert your specific and answerable research question(s) here. Bullet
points are OK. The idea is to be as clear as possible.

# Importance of the Project

- The importance of the research including what makes your research unique
and/or the specific contribution you seek to make.

- Even more important to your professor: Why is it worth spending an entire 
  semester on this?


# Method of Approach

The research methodology you will employ including location, data
collection techniques, analysis techniques, etc.

# Related Work

Here is a good place to summarize other work and make appropriate references
and citations.

Here is an example from a paper that Joe Kaylor and I are working on right
now.

In the past several years, many FUSE [@szeredi:fuse] based application
filesystems have been built to act as clients for popular web services
such as Flickr, IMAP email services, Amazon S3, and several others. In
our own research, we leveraged our existing NOFS framework to implement
RestFS [@Kaylor_RestFS], a dynamically reconfigurable filesystem for exposing
remote restful resources as a local filesystem. With RestFS, we were
able to demonstrate an architecture that could map several different
restful web services such as Yahoo! Placefinder, Flickr, and Twitter
into local filesystem representations. We were able to further
demonstrate how these web services and local software components could
be composed locally and re-exposed as restful web services.

# Work Plan

This is arguably the most important part of the proposal as it shows
*how* you will conduct your study. As such, it should be as realistic as
possible and very detailed. For my proposal I broke it down by what I
intended to accomplish each month.

This is just an example:

**August**

1.  Determine survey questions

**October**

1.  IRB request - 2 months
1.  Meet with committee

**November**

1.  Mail surveys
1.  Data Entry
1.  Submit abstract for professional conference paper or poster
    presentation

**December**

1.  Data Entry

**January**

1.  Data analysis and write-ups
1.  Begin writing thesis draft
1.  Brown bag presentation to department

**February - April**

1.  Continue writing thesis and revise when necessary
1.  Submit draft to committee for review

**May**

1.  Final draft complete by end of May with committee revisions

# Budget

This should be as detailed as possible but simple to understand. A
simple table with line items should suffice. Any descriptions or
justifications can be done below the table.

This might not be applicable to COMP 336-436 projects. If you have any
requirements in this regard, however, it is good to list them. In some
cases the department can find funds to support project needs, especially
for highly meritorious projects.
