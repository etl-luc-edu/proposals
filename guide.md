Preamble
========

This guide is intended for any student who wants to do research and
development projects in computer science (via the Emerging Technologies
Laboratory) under Profs. Läufer and/or Thiruvathukal. This document was
initially conceived by Drs. Läufer and Thiruvathukal, who found
themselves routinely asked by students to sponsor independent study
and/or “give them something to do for independent study”.

In reality, in most cases, the situation begins awkwardly. We (the
professors) scratch our heads to think of a topic. You (the student)
pretend to be interested when you would rather work on something else.
And in many cases, you as a student have at least as good--if not
better--ideas than we as professors do. There’s often a back and forth
process that goes on for some time. It’s mostly healthy for everyone
involved but, suffice it to say, it is not an entirely repeatable
process and is one that causes trouble when the student only has 2-3
semesters to complete a meaningful research project (this applies to
both undergraduate and graduate students), given that we are presently
limited to supervising B.S. and M.S. level students.

This document aims to introduce a process that will help all of us to do
productive joint research that leads to a virtuous outcome. While the
principal focus of this document is research, we also believe this
process can be applied to pure development projects and business ideas.
We are open to supervising all types of work, provided that everyone’s
contributions and time is valued (and ownership is shared).

Definitions
===========

1.  Advisor: Refers to the faculty member with whom the student wishes
    to do research. This can be either or both of us.
2.  Research: This is increasingly becoming a gray area but should not
    be. We define research somewhat scientifically as a problem
    statement (or thesis) and an organized plan to make progress toward
    its solution.
3.  Development: The implementation associated with a research project.
    Development in the absence of actual analysis and experimental
    results is useful but is not considered research.

The remainder of this document outlines the core tenets of our research
vision. It is not necessarily in proper/topological order yet.

Proposal-Driven
===============

Every project idea needs to begin with a proposal. The proposal format
is flexible but must include at a minimum the following elements:

1.  title
2.  print abstract of 250 words or fewer
3.  tweetable abstract of 140 characters or fewer (can be the title in
    many cases)
4.  problem statement and thesis
5.  motivation: Why this project needs to be done (or re-done, if done
    previously)
6.  statement of work (not the same as the problem statement) and
    project management plan
7.  milestones and deliverables
8.  how the work will be disseminated (specific venues should be
    identified up front)

The proposal must be shared with the advisors before enrolling in an
independent study section. In addition, the proposal is a prerequisite
for getting regular meetings with the faculty member and/or research

Duration
========

In general, students should plan on spending at least one full academic
year on research. This may or may not include summer term. The ideal
would be to spend 3 semesters, because the first semester is typically
dedicated to taking foundational courses--at least one of which should
be with the Advisor.

Students in the last semester of study are not encouraged to consider
pursuing research. Instead we recommend either an internship or
independent study with another professor. Owing to the complex nature of
our research, we’ve seldom seen students accomplish anything meaningful
in one semester.

Undergraduate students in their senior year who are just now
contemplating research are encouraged to continue their studies at
Loyola in the MS program. In many cases, we can help to establish a
research plan from day one of your MS program.

Skills
======

In general, we seek research students with a strong, balanced portfolio
of skills. In particular, candidates should be strong in the following:

1.  written and oral communication
2.  theory of computer science, including but not limited to algorithms,
    programming languages, information theory, and conceptual
    foundations
3.  practice of computer science, especially in the areas of systems,
    architecture, and applications
4.  problem solving
5.  creative thinking and imagination

Programming Languages
=====================

Because so much of our work in one form or another requires programming,
we expect all students to be fluent in modern programming languages.
Knowledge of object-oriented programming languages is a must. Knowledge
of functional programming languages (and object-functional hybrids) is
increasingly becoming a “plus”. Knowledge of the tradition of computing
languages, especially for programming low-level systems (e.g. C and
relatives) is also considered a “plus” but in its own right is
considered insufficient.

In general, we’re less concerned with what languages you know than your
willingness to learn a language and use it well. As many of our projects
have a distributed focus, you are likely to be using more than one
language anyway. With our growing interest in programming across the
gamut of devices and systems, it is likely that you’ll need to learn at
least 2-3 languages to work effectively in our research.

Software Engineering
====================

We expect every student to acquire or become familiar with best
practices in software engineering. This includes but is not limited to
the following important topics:

1.  process: We are not snobs about what development process you use but
    insist that you use one. Regardless of whether you are part of a
    team or solo project, process is good for you. Students are strongly
    encouraged to take the Software Engineering course, where various
    methodologies are discussed.
2.  source code management and appropriate licensing: The use of a
    version control system (e.g. Mercurial, Subversion, etc.) is
    required for any software development work. In most cases, we prefer
    the use of free/open source software hosting sites (e.g. Google
    Code, SourceForge, Launchpad) and ask that you make us members of
    your team. Most of the time, the GNU GPL is the preferred license,
    because it gives protections to the software itself as opposed to
    its creators.
3.  documentation: We require excellent documentation to be produced
    every step of the way. In general, you should assume that your work
    may live beyond your efforts and may be extended or enhanced by us
    or future students. It is therefore critical that you write good
    documentation so others can understand your work. APWe documentation
    in its own right is considered insufficient to meet this
    requirement.
4.  testing: Because this tends to be shortchanged in most projects we
    have seen, unit and regression testing should be integrated with
    your day-to-day development activities. Test. Then code.

The absence of any sort of software engineering can result in a
full-grade letter deduction when we submit the independent study grade.

The ETL and Teamwork
====================

In general, we prefer students who are collaborative in nature and enjoy
working with others. This doesn’t mean that you have to do all of your
programming projects in a team setting. It does, however, mean that you
need to view your work as being part of a vision--a vision that is
shared with your advisor. Collaboration may come in the form of working
on papers, public distributions of software, and other artifacts.
Speaking of artifacts, this is the term that we want every research
student to think about. In computer science, a published paper is one
kind of artifact. Working software is another kind of artifact. So, too,
are technical reports and other kinds of public contributions (e.g.
helping out an open source project).

We also welcome students who perhaps are not excited about programming
but are willing to work on more theoretical and experimental work. This
would include but not be limited to algorithms, semantics, verification,
performance modeling, benchmarking, and testing.

Status Reports
==============

Weekly status reports are required, regardless of whether anything has
gotten done in the week leading up to the status report. Our philosophy
is that when you are forced to actually write the report, you build the
discipline needed to participate in our research efforts. It also gives
us the needed documentation to determine whether sufficient progress has
been made in the work you proposed.

Failing to turn in status reports can result in a reduction in your
grade (if you are working on independent study for a grade). Note that
it is possible to do research with us and not receive academic credit
(i.e. you are doing it for fun, which is the best way); however, you
must still provide weekly status reports.

We don't remind you about your status reports. However, should there
come a time where we don't think we are accomplishing anything by
working together, we will bring it to your attention.

Self-Assessment
===============

Every student is required to complete a self-assessment prior to finals
week when you are enrolled in Independent Study. A model of this form
will be made available shortly as a separate document.

Topical Areas of Interest
=========================

This is aimed at providing a list of general areas in which we are
always seeking qualified students. These are not specific topics, which
we keep on a separate page (by invitation only).

1.  programming languages

1.  software architecture and software frameworks
2.  operating systems
3.  scientific computing (mathematical or physical sciences)
4.  green computing/technology
5.  environmental science (sensors and simulation)
6.  digital humanities (electronic editing, collaboration tools, and
    archival projects)
7.  mobile/smartphone development (Android and iOS)
8.  embedded/pervasive computing (OpenWrt)

In general, if your interests do not fall into one of these general
areas, we ask that you consider contributing to a free/open source
software development project.

We will be happy to support any student for independent study credit who
is self-motivated and wants to use his/her talent to make the world a
better place, consistent with our university’s [stated
mission](http://www.luc.edu/mission/mission_vision.shtml). FOSS and
other efforts with a strong service component are particularly welcome.

Plaintext Authoring
===================

In general, we encourage all students to work with collaborative
documentation tools that are web based. Google Documents has proven to
be effective in the initial stages, especially for organizing the
content for a prospective publication.

For final manuscript preparation, the preferred authoring frameworks are
[LyX](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyx.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGqNJrwoqPE9q1pN61RI70f9b5w8Q),
a graphical front-end to the
[LaTeX](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.latex-project.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF0zVYkI_QnKcGeyiTZfliAR9Suuw)
document preparation system, or
[LaTeX](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.latex-project.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF0zVYkI_QnKcGeyiTZfliAR9Suuw)
itself. Both tools works on all major platforms of interest, including
Windows (Mik-TeX), OS X (MacTex), and Ubuntu (via texlive-full).

Additional Collaboration Tools
==============================

We expect all students to embrace the following “best-of-breed”
collaboration/communication tools:

1.  distributed version control (for code and LyX/LaTeX documents):
    Mercurial (hg), usually hosted by Bitbucket.org for private
    repositories, and Git, usually hosted by GitHub.com for public
    repositories
2.  wiki: Google Sites
3.  project management: Basecamp
4.  instant messaging: primarily Google Talk, including group chat when
    necessary
5.  shared whiteboard: Dabbleboard
6.  shared bookmarks: delicious (by making klaufer and gkthiruvathukal
    part of your network)

We expect students to subscribe to automatic notification by email or
RSS/Atom feeds provided by these tools. Students are encouraged to
discuss other potentially useful tools with us.

Independent Study Enrollment
============================

All students are expected to enroll in one of our Independent Study
sections. We ask that you send an e-mail message to Jean Rom (our
department secretary, jrom1@luc.edu) and both of us (gkt@cs.luc.edu,
laufer@cs.luc.edu) with an e-mail similar to the following.

> Dear Ms. Rom:
> 
> Please enroll me for N credits of Independent Study in Dr.
> Thiruvathukal’s or Dr. Laufer’s section. I have submitted a proposal to
> both for their consideration and expect their approval of this request.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Student


One of us will respond (reply to all) to indicate our approval of your
request, after which an administrative override will be performed to
allow you to enroll in our section.

We are working to establish a section that is common to both of us but
for the time being will be assigning students randomly to our respective
sections. We encourage you to consider signing up for 2 credits with one
of us, and 1 credit with the other. You can mix/match credits any way
you like but should assign the majority of the credits to whichever of
us will act as your primary supervisor. In most cases, we will advise
you based on your proposal as to which of us is most closely aligned
with your proposed work.
